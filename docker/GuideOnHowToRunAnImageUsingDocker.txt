* install docker gui from AUR or bash version by terminal (pacman -S docker on arch)

  PULL the image you want to use by using the docker pull command

  ex:

    # docker pull ubuntu

run the image on bash by using 

    # docker run -ti --rm ubuntu /bin/bash

  This command tells Docker to run the Docker Ubuntu container in an interactive terminal mode (-ti).
  The /bin/bash argument is a way of telling the container to run the Bash shell terminal.
  Finally, the --rm flag instructs Docker to automatically remove the Ubuntu Docker container after we stop it.

  You can verify if docker is running the os you want by using

    $ cat /etc/os-release

  which will return the exact details about the image you want

  if you want to run an specific version of the os you may as well add the version ID

    # docker pull ubunutu:20.04

  After closing the docker terminal all the changes will be discarted. To save any alterations you may've done, use the preceding command

    $ docker commit -p container_id new_container_name

  notice that there's no need to use root mode while running your docker image, as it will altomatically log in by root.
  Also, remember to replace "container_id" with whatever id docker shows you on terminal

  ex:
    $ docker commit -p 132013ca9750 myubuntu


  You can also check the image id by running sudo docker ps (if the image is still running on another terminal) or docker images (if it isn't)
Be aware that the "commit" command doesnt save your image, but creates another one with all the changes you've made. to acess the new image
you gotta run the command on the 11 line replacing "ubuntu" with "myubuntu"
